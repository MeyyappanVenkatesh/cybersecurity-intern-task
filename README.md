## Brief Note
My approach centered on **multi-tenant isolation as the existential risk** for ClientHub's SaaS architecture — prioritizing realistic attacker behavior over theoretical threats. I applied defense-in-depth principles with AWS-native controls, balanced containment urgency with evidence preservation in incident response, and grounded all recommendations in business impact (GDPR fines, client churn) rather than generic "best practices."
